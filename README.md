# SoftwarePattern

This is a project which includes the commen software pattern.

## Creational Patterns

### Factory Pattern

#### Factory Method Pattern
It creates during runtime a concrete object 

#### Abstract Factory Pattern
it creates during runtime a object family

### Singleton Pattern
It creates just ONE instance of a class.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
It translates the methods of a client via an adapter to a target interface.

### Composite Pattern
This pattern treated primitive and composite objects in a same way.

### Decorator Pattern
This pattern adds functionality to a existing component.

### Facade Pattern
Via this pattern, the client will get an interface to call for example just one method instead a bunch of methods of several subsystems.

### Flyweight Pattern
In case of creating serveral objects of a few dedicated classes, it can be used for memory optimization

### Proxy Pattern

#### Protection Pattern
This pattern is useful to protect some functionality or access to other objects

#### Virtual Pattern
This pattern is usefull to delay the request of expensive data

## Behavioral Patterns

### Command Pattern
Operations can be queued, logged and reversed

### Iterator Pattern
Via this pattern it is possible to iterate through each kind of datastructure with different behaviors

### Mediator Pattern
Objects can communicate with each other via a loosely coupled mediator

### Memento Pattern
States of objects can be stored and restored

### Observer Pattern
Several objects can subscribe to one object and will be notified when the status changes

### State Pattern
Change the behavior of an object during runtime

### Strategy Pattern
With this pattern it is possible to change the implemented strategy during runtime.

### Template Pattern
Some pieces of an algorithm can be exchanged.

## Others

### Repository Design Pattern (ToDo)
### Data-Access-Object Pattern (ToDo)
### Inversion of Control (ToDo)
### Publisher Subscriber Pattern (ToDo)
