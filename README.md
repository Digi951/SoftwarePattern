This is a project which includes the commen software pattern.

## Creational Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
It creates just ONE instance of a class.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
It translates the methods of a client via an adapter to a target interface.

### Composite Pattern

### Decorator Pattern
This pattern adds functionality to a existing component.

### Facade Pattern
Via this pattern, the client will get an interface to call for example just one method instead a bunch of methods of several subsystems.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Iterator Pattern
Via this pattern it is possible to iterate through each kind of datastructure with different behaviors

### Mediator Pattern
Objects can communicate with each other via a loosely coupled mediator

### Observer Pattern
Several objects can subscribe to one object and will be notified when the status changes
